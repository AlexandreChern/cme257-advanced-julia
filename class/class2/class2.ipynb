    "\n",
    "If you have primarily programmed in Python, MATLAB, or R, you likely haven't had to think too much about types before.  This makes it easier to write code, but ultimately can make it difficult to write code that is fast and memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have experience in C, C++, or Fortran, you probably already know something about types - today we'll see how Types work in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a type in a programming language, you are telling the computer\n",
    "* How a variable should be stored\n",
    "* Something about how you intend to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you haven't seen types before in programming, you should already have some intution from mathematics - consider for example, integers $Z$, real numbers $R$, and complex numbers $C$ - you can think of these as types\n",
    "* $Z$, $R$, and $C$ are closed under addition and subtraction (+ takes two inputs and has a deterministic output)\n",
    "* You can divide in $R$ and $C$ (except for 0), but not in $Z$ (3 / 2?)\n",
    "* You know something about representing an element on a piece of paper: $Z$ (no decimal, but maybe a symbol $-$), $R$ (perhaps you need a decimal), and $C$, (you can use two real numbers and a symbol $i$)\n",
    "* You can represent an integer as a real number, and a real number as a complex number, but not the other ways around (this is an example of type promotion)\n",
    "* Certain functions have outputs in one of these sets.  For example, a square root is generally complex (an example of output type)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using types in programming allows you to share your knowledge about all these issues with a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't use types in ```demofunc``` which made programming very easy for us.  However, this means that the compiler/interpreter can't assume too much about our inputs $x$ and $y$, or what we're going to do with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Types can be useful for several reasons\n",
    "* They give the complier/interpreter information that can be used to make code faster and more memory efficient\n",
    "* Figuring things out is done at complie time, not run time\n",
    "* They help you (the programmer) keep track of what code should be doing\n",
    "* They prevent the code from being used in unintended ways ('h' + 2^2?)\n",
