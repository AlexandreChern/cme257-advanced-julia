    "## What is Julia?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) is a relatively new language designed for scientific computing.  You'll find similarities to MATLAB and Python, but will also find differences.  It is rapidly gaining popularity in the scientific computing community (for example, its optimization pacakges are very popular).  Lots of development is happening at MIT, but Stanford has its fair share of users and contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features (see [julialang.org](http://julialang.org/)):\n",
    "* multiple dispatch functions (overload for different argument type combinations)\n",
    "* dynamic type system (user-defined types perform well)\n",
    "* macros and metaprogramming\n",
    "* call python and C\n",
    "* parallelism and distributed execution\n",
    "* built on LLVM\n",
    "* just-in-time compiliation (JIT)"
